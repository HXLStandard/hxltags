==================================================================================

Build a machine-learning model for mapping text headers to HXL hashtags using a Naive Bayes Classifier. For more information about HXL, see https://hxlstandard.org

## Requirements

- Python 3
- libhxl
- textblob

## Usage

This package uses the output from https://github.com/HXLStandard/hdx-hashtag-crawler

The distribution includes a snapshot in inputs/ (but you can create your own, fresher one)
